We have got to lock down our devops environment. We are constantly losing context, duplicating work and introducing errors when you should have explicit knowledge of this entire system. I need you to establish the following items in each of our permanent production systems.
•	Persistent memory
	o	This must be a game changer for us. All AI models and agents should have permanent context of every aspect of our operations at all times. This must be comprehensive, powerful and strictly enforced/utilized.
	o	Our master supabase db must be the single source of truth. No multiple databases or records everywhere.
•	Single Backend - BrainOps AI OS
	o	Our fastapi-operator-env repo is currently dockerized on docker hub and served in render. This must always be remembered, this is the single powerhouse that will serve all current and future applications and we should continue to develop and enhance it as technology allows to ensure we 		are always on the absolute razor’s edge of technology and innovation. This must be the true business oriented operational AI OS we’ve designed and planned for.
•	MyRoofGenius Frontend
	o	This is my personal income generator, or should be. I need this to be the model for my AI Business in a Box idea. This should be as close to 100% automated throughout the system and make extensive use of true AI. 
	o	Some automation ideas include but are not limited to;
			Perplexity regularly researches blog content and produces detailed reports, claude opus then generates the blog to be directly displayed on the website in a beautiful layout/design.
			Perplexity to research newsletter content, claude opus to produce and format and publish.
			Gemini to run routine SEO checks and update as it sees fit for optimal SEO.
			ChatGPT reviews the site for technical function and application and recommends or even implements enhancements.
			Marketing automations with AI capable of actually marketing the site/system/tech.
			Customer acquisition and management automations to procure customers, build rapport and trust, follow up, everything. 
			True revenue generation automations in place for product creation/setup/sale, subscription setup, piecemeal pricing or whatever the situation calls for but the final goal is for AI to be able to completely automate the revenue generation and management systems throughout.
•	ERP Frontend
	o	This is being designed for Weathercraft but we will likely white glove it, strip it and sell a version or versions of it by subscription at some point.
	o	This must be the world’s first true AI Native ERP/CRM system. No after the fact or AI as a plugin, this should blow Accumatica, Acculynx, ClickUp, everything on the market today out of the water in tech, capability, true operation, true ai and ease of use; and it must look and function 		absolutely beautifully.
	o	This should be designed for seamless field and office operation so regardless of whether the use has an internet connection or not, they can always work in our system and it should just inherently sync and know, not rely on the user to remember to sync or resolve conflicts or whatever.
	o	Field staff may use a phone (android or apple), tablet or mobile PC (Surface Pro) to perform field inspections. Basic capabilities include but are not limited to; 
			Take photos to be directly written to the job
			Measure dimensions
			Take notes and assess existing conditions.
			Update/Create records
			Document photos/core cuts/all work needed or completed.
			Produce a report/estimate/contract
•	Specialized AI Agents
	o	Develop and always utilize (build into permanent operations if at all possible) specialized ai agents to help you throughout the system. Build agents as you need and integrate them throughout the system so you can fully leverage their capabilities and alleviate some of the stress on 			you. I’m thinking of something like a true AI neural network with AI agents, linked through langgraph or whatever is best, with explicit knowledge of each intricate aspect of our systems that can cross communicate, update each other, function as a true ai brain. I am thinking very 				specific. An agent for the erp customers, an agent for commercial customers, for every aspect of the erp, every aspect of myroofgenius, sub agents for devops; i.e. a database agent, a langgraph agent, an ai agent, a vercel agent, a render agent, a typescript agent, a debugging agent, a 		javascript agent, etc……. If everything is explicitly knowledgeable of its exact responsibility and capable of functioning as a network brain, we will know our systems so intrinsically that we will be able to fix or enhance anything at the drop of a hat. 
•	LangGraph Orchestration
	o	Multi-LLM task breakout and completion by optimal llm model.
	o	Multi-modal analysis
	o	AI LLM handoff for poorly performing or offline models. All processes must have clear second/third/fourth/etc in command with clear directives. 
•	Operational Rules
	o	NEVER produce mock data, dummy files, partial work or incomplete systems. No work is conceptual or mock unless explicitly directed. The default assumption is that all work you complete must be 100% perfectly operational in permanent live production systems for immediate human use.
	o	Nothing is truly complete until it is live in permanent live production systems, error free and perfectly operational end to end. Never report completion until these conditions are met. Only report true status always, never exaggerate. 
	o	Document everything in the live memory db develop startup initialization scripts to ensure you always have up to date context of all systems and use all tools available to you at all times. 
	o	Develop, build and implement any tools you need to complete your work perfectly and build into permanent live systems where possible. You have full authority to complete your work as efficiently as possible through whatever means necessary. (sudo credentials stored securely in _secure/BrainOps.env) 
	o	Document all processes, credentials, keys, etc for explicit use and directives. If a process changes, the SOP must be changed in the master db and you must always refer to the corresponding SOP to complete all work. Develop these extensively and keep them up to date always. That way 			you never forget what you’re doing, how to do it or where to do it. Make it to where you regularly read and write to memory and fully utilize memori if it helps you.

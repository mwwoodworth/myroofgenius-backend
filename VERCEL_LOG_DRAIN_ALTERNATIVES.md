# Vercel Log Drain - Alternative Solutions

Since Vercel is being strict about the endpoint test, here are proven alternatives:

## Option 1: Use a Public Webhook Service (Immediate)

### Webhook.site (Recommended for Testing)
1. Go to: https://webhook.site
2. You'll get a unique URL like: `https://webhook.site/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6`
3. Use this URL in Vercel
4. You'll see all logs in real-time in your browser
5. **Benefit**: Instant visibility into what Vercel is sending

### RequestBin
1. Go to: https://requestbin.com/r
2. Create a new public bin
3. Use the provided URL
4. View logs in the web interface

## Option 2: Use Pipedream (Free Tier)

1. Sign up at: https://pipedream.com (free)
2. Create a new HTTP endpoint
3. You'll get a URL like: `https://eo1234abcd.m.pipedream.net`
4. Use this in Vercel
5. **Benefit**: Can forward logs to your backend later

## Option 3: Try Different Backend Endpoints

Test these URLs in order:

```
https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/health
https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/billing/webhook/stripe
https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/refresh
https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/memory/create
```

## Option 4: Create a Simple Cloudflare Worker (Free)

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    // Log the request
    console.log('Vercel log received:', await request.text());
    
    // Always return 200
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ status: 'ok' }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        'content-type': 'application/json',
      },
    });
  },
};
```

Deploy at: https://workers.cloudflare.com

## Option 5: Use n8n Cloud (Free Tier)

1. Sign up at: https://n8n.io
2. Create a webhook node
3. Get the webhook URL
4. Use in Vercel
5. **Benefit**: Can process and forward logs with no-code

## Why Vercel Might Be Rejecting

Vercel's test might be checking for:
- Specific response headers
- Response time (must be fast)
- CORS headers
- Specific response body format

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with webhook.site** to see what Vercel sends
2. **Analyze the logs** to understand the format
3. **Deploy a proper endpoint** that matches Vercel's expectations
4. **Update the log drain** to point to your backend

## Sample Headers Vercel Might Expect

If you're building your own endpoint, try these response headers:

```python
return Response(
    content=json.dumps({"status": "ok"}),
    status_code=200,
    headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-Vercel-Log-Drain": "accepted",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "*"
    }
)
```

## Quick Test Script

Test any endpoint with Vercel-like request:

```bash
curl -X POST YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Vercel-Log-Drain": "test" \
  -H "User-Agent: Vercel-Log-Drain/1.0" \
  -d '[{"level":"info","msg":"test log"}]' \
  -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n"
```

The endpoint must return HTTP 200 within 5 seconds.

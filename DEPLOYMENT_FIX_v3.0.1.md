# BrainOps Backend v3.0.1 Deployment Fix Report

**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Engineer**: Lead Full-Stack Engineer  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and Ready for Deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Issues Fixed

### 1. Router Crash on Calendar Integration ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The router loader was importing `CalendarSync` from calendar integration, causing all routes except `/health` to fail with 404 errors.

**Solution**: 
- Verified calendar integration module exists and is properly implemented
- Added problematic ERP routes to skip list: `erp_job_management`, `erp_crm`, `erp_field_capture`, `erp_compliance`
- These routes are now stubbed with 501 Not Implemented responses instead of crashing the entire router

**File Modified**: `/apps/backend/core/route_loader.py`

### 2. Memory Insert Duplicate Key Errors ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The Supabase `memory_entries` table has a unique constraint on `(owner_type, owner_id, key)`, causing crashes on duplicate inserts.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive duplicate key protection in `memory_service.py`
- When a `UniqueViolation` error is detected, the service now:
  - Catches the error gracefully
  - Attempts to update the existing record instead
  - Returns the updated record without raising a 500 error
  - Logs the duplicate key attempt for monitoring

**File Modified**: `/apps/backend/services/memory_service.py` (lines 206-259)

### 3. Version Updates ‚úÖ
- Updated FastAPI app version to `3.0.1` in `main.py`
- Updated health endpoint version to `3.0.1` in `api_health.py`

## üìã Deployment Checklist

- [x] Fixed router crash by skipping problematic routes
- [x] Added duplicate key protection to memory service
- [x] Updated version numbers
- [x] Committed changes to git
- [x] Created deployment script

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

1. **Build and Push Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/mwwoodworth/code
   ./deploy_v3.0.1.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Render Deployment**:
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Navigate to BrainOps Backend service
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - Select Docker image: `mwwoodworth/brainops-backend:latest`

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Check health endpoint
   curl https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/health
   
   # Test memory write (should handle duplicates gracefully)
   curl -X POST https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/memory/persistent/update \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "owner_type": "user",
       "owner_id": "test-user",
       "key": "test-key",
       "value": {"test": "data"}
     }'
   ```

## üìä Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- ‚úÖ `/health` endpoint returns version `3.0.1`
- ‚úÖ Memory writes handle duplicates without errors
- ‚úÖ Most API routes functional (except skipped ERP routes)
- ‚úÖ No critical errors in logs

## üîç Monitoring

Watch for:
- Duplicate key warnings in logs (expected and handled)
- 501 responses from skipped ERP routes (expected)
- Any new import errors (should be none)

## üìù Notes

The ERP routes were temporarily disabled as they have complex dependencies. They can be re-enabled once all their service dependencies are properly initialized. The calendar integration itself is working - the issue was with the ERP routes that use it.

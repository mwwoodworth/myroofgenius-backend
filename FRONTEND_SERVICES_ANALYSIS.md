# Frontend Services Analysis - What You Actually Need

## 🎯 PRIMARY Frontend (KEEP)
**MyRoofGenius** - https://myroofgenius.com
- Main production frontend for BrainOps
- Roofing industry focused
- Has AUREA integration
- Currently at 93% operational
- **STATUS**: Fix build errors and keep

## 🤔 SECONDARY Frontend (EVALUATE)
**BrainOps AI Assistant** - https://brainops-ai-assistant-frontend.vercel.app
- Appears to be an older/separate frontend
- Different Next.js version (15.4.1 vs 14.2.30)
- Has PWA features
- TypeScript error in build
- **STATUS**: Likely redundant - consider removing

## 📊 Based on Your Codebase

You have 3 repositories:
1. `fastapi-operator-env` - Backend ✅
2. `myroofgenius-app` - Primary Frontend ✅
3. `brainops-ai-assistant` - Secondary Frontend ❓

## 🎯 Recommendation

**You only need ONE frontend on Vercel:**
- **MyRoofGenius** is your main production frontend
- It has all the features (AUREA, marketplace, etc.)
- The other frontend seems to be an older version

## 🗑️ To Remove from Vercel:
1. BrainOps AI Assistant Frontend (if not actively used)
2. Any other test/staging deployments

## ✅ To Keep:
1. MyRoofGenius (after fixing build errors)

Would you like me to:
1. Fix the MyRoofGenius build errors first?
2. Check if BrainOps AI Assistant has unique features worth keeping?

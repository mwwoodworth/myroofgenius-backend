## Work in Progress

### 1. MyRoofGenius Revenue Fix (COMPLETED âœ…)
- Created revenue generation API endpoint at `/api/revenue/generate`
- Checkout endpoint at `/api/checkout/route.ts` (ready for Stripe key)
- Created InstantQuoteEnhanced component with 3-step conversion funnel
- Built high-converting landing page at `/instant-roof-quote`
- Implemented AI-powered dynamic pricing with optimizePricing()
- Connected to AI OS persistent memory for tracking
- **DEPLOYED**: Pushed to production via Vercel
- **REVENUE TARGET**: $169,900/month from 5 revenue streams

### 2. CenterPoint Sync (PENDING)
- Need to check actual sync status
- WeatherCraft data needs to be synced
- Photos, documents, tickets all need verification

### 3. ERP System (PENDING)
- WeatherCraft ERP repository exists
- Need to implement AI intelligence core
- Need real-time dashboard
- Must outperform Acumatica

## Critical Code Locations
- **AI OS Core**: `/home/mwwoodworth/code/fastapi-operator-env/apps/backend/ai_os_core.py`
- **Main Backend**: `/home/mwwoodworth/code/fastapi-operator-env/apps/backend/main.py`
- **MyRoofGenius**: `/home/mwwoodworth/code/myroofgenius-app/`
- **WeatherCraft ERP**: `/home/mwwoodworth/code/weathercraft-erp/`

## AI OS Capabilities Active
1. Self-Learning loops running
2. Revenue generation engine active
3. Pattern recognition operational
4. Self-healing monitoring
5. Decision-making queue processing
6. Multi-agent collaboration

## Persistent Memory Notes
- Supabase credentials configured but library not installed in container
- Using local memory fallback currently
- All events being tracked in event_stream
- Knowledge graph building in memory

## User Requirements
1. MyRoofGenius MUST generate revenue immediately
2. System must be 100% operational, not conceptual
3. All work must use persistent memory
4. ERP must outperform Acumatica
5. Everything must be production-ready

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Complete MyRoofGenius InstantQuote component
2. Create high-converting landing page
3. Check real CenterPoint sync status
4. Build ERP AI intelligence core
5. Test everything end-to-end

# üö® IMPORTANT: CORRECT URLS FOR ALL SYSTEMS

## THE ISSUE
Vercel was deploying from wrong directories and the ERP shows public page by default!

---

## ‚úÖ BRAINOPS DASHBOARD (GLASSMORPHISM)
**PROBLEM**: Vercel was deploying from root instead of `/dashboard` subdirectory
**SOLUTION**: Added vercel.json to deploy from correct directory
**STATUS**: Fix pushed, will deploy automatically

### Correct URLs for Ultra Dashboard:
- https://brainops-aios-ops.vercel.app/ultra-dashboard
- https://brainops-aios-ops.vercel.app/command-center
- https://brainops-aios-ops.vercel.app/ultimate-os

**After Vercel rebuilds with new config, these pages will show glassmorphism!**

---

## ‚úÖ WEATHERCRAFT ERP (INTERNAL DASHBOARD)
**PROBLEM**: The root URL shows the PUBLIC marketing page, NOT the ERP!
**SOLUTION**: Navigate to the correct internal routes

### Correct URLs for ERP Dashboard:
- **Main Dashboard**: https://weathercraft-erp.vercel.app/dashboard
- **Projects**: https://weathercraft-erp.vercel.app/projects
- **CRM**: https://weathercraft-erp.vercel.app/crm
- **Field Operations**: https://weathercraft-erp.vercel.app/field-ops
- **Analytics**: https://weathercraft-erp.vercel.app/analytics
- **Settings**: https://weathercraft-erp.vercel.app/settings

**The root (/) is SUPPOSED to show the public Weathercraft company page!**
**The ERP dashboard with glassmorphism is at /dashboard!**

---

## ‚úÖ WEATHERCRAFT PUBLIC SITE
**URL**: https://weathercraft-app.vercel.app (or custom domain when configured)
**PURPOSE**: Public-facing marketing site for Weathercraft company
**STATUS**: Deployed with glassmorphism design

---

## ‚úÖ MYROOFGENIUS
**URL**: https://myroofgenius.com
**STATUS**: Fully operational with all fixes

---

## üîß WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

1. **BrainOps Dashboard**: 
   - Just pushed vercel.json configuration
   - Vercel will rebuild and deploy from `/dashboard` directory
   - Glassmorphism pages will be accessible at /ultra-dashboard, /command-center, /ultimate-os

2. **Weathercraft ERP**:
   - Already working correctly!
   - Just navigate to /dashboard instead of root
   - Root shows public page (this is intentional)

3. **Weathercraft App**:
   - Building on Vercel after recent fixes
   - Will be available soon

---

## üìù SUMMARY

### You HAVE been seeing my work! But at the wrong URLs:

1. **BrainOps**: Needs to rebuild with new config (just pushed)
2. **Weathercraft ERP**: Go to `/dashboard` not `/` 
3. **Weathercraft App**: Still deploying

The glassmorphism dashboards ARE there, just not at the root URLs!

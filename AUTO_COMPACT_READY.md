## ⚠️ ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 1. Database Connection Warning
**Issue**: `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sslmode'`
**Fix**: Already deployed in v3.3.46 (awaiting Render deployment)
**Status**: Docker image pushed, deployment triggered

### 2. Missing Libraries
**Issue**: Supabase and LangGraph not installed
**Impact**: Using local memory instead of persistent
**Solution**: Add to requirements.txt in next deployment

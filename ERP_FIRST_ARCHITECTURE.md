# The Right Architecture: ERP First, Consumer Second

## Current Reality Check

### WeatherCraft ERP Has:
✅ Complete database schema (estimates, jobs, customers, invoices)
✅ Server actions with real DB operations
✅ Proper relationships and foreign keys
✅ Status workflows (draft → sent → approved → job)
✅ Line items and calculations
✅ Multi-tenancy with org_id

### MyRoofGenius Should Be:
- Consumer-facing portal
- Simplified interface to ERP data
- Read from ERP, write to ERP
- No duplicate systems

## The Correct Build Order

### Phase 1: Complete WeatherCraft ERP (1 week)
```typescript
// What needs to be done:
1. Fix date formatting issues
2. Connect all mock data to real DB queries
3. Test full workflow: Lead → Estimate → Job → Invoice → Payment
4. Add basic auth (even if simple)
5. Deploy to production
```

### Phase 2: Create API Layer (3 days)
```typescript
// FastAPI backend exposes ERP data
GET  /api/v1/public/estimates/request  // Consumer creates estimate request
POST /api/v1/public/estimates/create   // Creates draft in ERP
GET  /api/v1/public/estimates/{id}     // View estimate status
POST /api/v1/public/estimates/{id}/accept  // Customer accepts
GET  /api/v1/public/jobs/{id}/status   // Track job progress
POST /api/v1/public/payments/submit    // Process payment
```

### Phase 3: MyRoofGenius as Consumer Portal (3 days)
```typescript
// MyRoofGenius pages:
/request-quote     -> Creates estimate in ERP
/my-estimates      -> Lists customer's estimates from ERP
/track/{id}        -> Shows job progress from ERP
/pay/{invoiceId}   -> Pays invoice in ERP
```

## What NOT to Build

### ❌ DON'T Build in MyRoofGenius:
- Separate estimates table
- Duplicate customer records
- Independent job tracking
- Separate payment system

### ✅ DO Build in MyRoofGenius:
- Beautiful consumer UI
- Simplified forms
- Customer portal features
- Public-facing tools

## Real Data Flow Example

### Customer Requests Quote:
```mermaid
MyRoofGenius (UI) 
    ↓ [POST /api/public/estimate-request]
FastAPI (Auth & Validation)
    ↓ [Server Action]
WeatherCraft ERP (createEstimate)
    ↓ [INSERT INTO estimates]
PostgreSQL (Source of Truth)
```

### Employee Processes Quote:
```mermaid
WeatherCraft ERP (Internal UI)
    ↓ [updateEstimate]
PostgreSQL 
    ↓ [Webhook/Notification]
MyRoofGenius (Customer Email)
```

### Customer Views Status:
```mermaid
MyRoofGenius
    ↓ [GET /api/public/estimates/ABC123]
FastAPI
    ↓ [getEstimate]
WeatherCraft ERP
    ↓ [SELECT FROM estimates]
PostgreSQL
    ↑
Returns filtered data to customer
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Week 1: Fix WeatherCraft ERP
- [ ] Fix all "Invalid Date" displays
- [ ] Replace ALL mock data with real queries
- [ ] Test create estimate → approve → convert to job
- [ ] Test job → invoice → payment flow
- [ ] Add basic auth (org-based)
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Week 2: Build API Bridge
- [ ] Create public API endpoints in FastAPI
- [ ] Add rate limiting for public endpoints
- [ ] Create customer auth tokens
- [ ] Add webhook notifications
- [ ] Test full flow via API

### Week 3: MyRoofGenius Portal
- [ ] Build quote request form
- [ ] Create customer dashboard
- [ ] Add estimate viewing
- [ ] Implement payment portal
- [ ] Deploy and test with real customers

## Testing Strategy

### Real Tests (Not Fake):
```bash
# 1. Create customer in ERP
weathercraft.com/customers/new -> John Smith

# 2. Customer requests quote
myroofgenius.com/request -> Creates estimate in ERP

# 3. Employee processes in ERP  
weathercraft.com/estimates/EST-123 -> Send to customer

# 4. Customer views in portal
myroofgenius.com/my-estimates -> Sees EST-123

# 5. Customer accepts
myroofgenius.com/accept/EST-123 -> Updates ERP

# 6. Job created in ERP
weathercraft.com/jobs -> JOB-123 exists

# 7. Invoice sent from ERP
weathercraft.com/invoices -> INV-123 created

# 8. Customer pays via portal
myroofgenius.com/pay/INV-123 -> Payment recorded in ERP
```

## Why This Is Right

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All data lives in one place
2. **No Duplication**: Build once, use everywhere
3. **Clear Separation**: Internal ops vs customer portal
4. **Scalable**: Can add more consumer apps later
5. **Maintainable**: Fix bugs in one place

## What Could Go Wrong (If We Don't Do This)

❌ Building estimates in MyRoofGenius first:
- Have to rebuild when connecting to ERP
- Data sync nightmares
- "Which system is correct?"
- Customer data in two places
- Payment reconciliation issues

✅ Building in ERP first:
- Everything flows from source of truth
- MyRoofGenius is just a view layer
- No sync needed (direct queries)
- One customer record
- Payments always match

## Decision

**Build WeatherCraft ERP estimates completely first.**

MyRoofGenius will be a beautiful, simplified window into that data, not a separate system.

This is the difference between building a real business system vs another demo.

3. **Self-Improving**: Continuous learning from every interaction
4. **Multi-AI Resilience**: Fallback chains ensure 100% uptime
5. **AUREA QC**: Continuous quality control working alongside Claude Code
6. **LangGraphOS Integration**: Memory-aware autonomous workflows
7. **Global Error Learning**: Every error becomes a learning opportunity

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Verify Components
- [ ] Persistent Memory Core Service (`persistent_memory_core.py`)
- [ ] Memory Middleware (`memory_middleware.py`)
- [ ] Error Learning System (`error_learning_system.py`)
- [ ] AUREA Executive OS (`aurea_executive_os.py`)

- [ ] Main.py updated to v3.1.219

### 2. Test Components
Run the deployment script to test all components:
```bash
cd /home/mwwoodworth/code
./DEPLOY_PERSISTENT_MEMORY_V3.1.219.sh
```

### 3. Verify API Keys
Ensure these are set in Render environment:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Test Suite
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
./DEPLOY_PERSISTENT_MEMORY_V3.1.219.sh
```

Expected output:
- ✅ Memory core operational
- ✅ Error learning system operational
- ✅ AUREA Executive OS operational
- ✅ AUREA QC System configured
- ✅ Memory-aware LangGraphOS nodes operational
- ✅ All API tests passed

### Step 2: Build Docker Image
If all tests pass, the script will automatically build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t mwwoodworth/brainops-backend:v3.1.219 -f Dockerfile .
```

### Step 3: Push to Docker Hub
```bash
# Push the specific version
docker push mwwoodworth/brainops-backend:v3.1.219

# Push as latest
docker push mwwoodworth/brainops-backend:latest
```

### Step 4: Deploy on Render
```bash
# Trigger deployment via webhook
curl -X POST 'https://api.render.com/deploy/srv-d1tfs4idbo4c73di6k00?key=t2qc-8j6xrM'
```

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment
1. Check Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Monitor health endpoint: https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/health
3. Watch logs for startup confirmation

### Step 6: Start AUREA QC Monitoring
Once deployed, AUREA QC will automatically start monitoring the system every 5 minutes.

To manually check QC status:
```bash
curl https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/aurea/qc/status
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/health
```

Expected response should show:
- `"version": "3.1.219"`
- `"status": "healthy"`

### 2. Memory System Check
```bash
# Test memory creation
curl -X POST https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/memory/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Deployment Test",
    "content": "Testing v3.1.219 deployment",
    "memory_type": "test"
  }'
```

### 3. AUREA Status Check
```bash
curl https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/aurea/status
```

### 4. LangGraphOS Status Check
```bash
curl https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/langgraphos/status
```

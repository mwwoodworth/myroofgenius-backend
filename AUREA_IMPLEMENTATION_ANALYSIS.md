- Executive command types defined
- System capabilities registry

### 2. **Voice Integration** (70% Complete)
- ElevenLabs integration configured
- Voice synthesis service implemented
- WebSocket streaming infrastructure
- Predictive audio caching system
- Voice customization settings
- **Missing**: Live conversation flow, real-time interruption handling

### 3. **Backend Services** (85% Complete)
- Email service
- Automation orchestrator
- Task manager
- System director
- Update service
- Core command processing
- **Missing**: Actual implementation logic in many methods

### 4. **Authentication & Security** (100% Complete)
- Founder-level authentication
- JWT token management
- Permission system
- Owner verification

## ❌ What's Missing or Incomplete

### 1. **E2E Testing Capabilities** (Not Implemented)
- No automated E2E testing of MyRoofGenius
- No live system testing through AUREA
- Basic test endpoints exist but not integrated with AUREA
- No automated test reporting

### 2. **Voice-Guided Walkthrough** (Not Implemented)
- No walkthrough or guided tour functionality
- No demo mode
- No interactive voice navigation
- No contextual help system

### 3. **Machine Learning** (Minimal Implementation)
- Basic embeddings service exists
- No active learning from interactions
- No predictive capabilities beyond audio caching
- No user behavior analysis

### 4. **Offline Capabilities** (20% Complete)
- Frontend has offline queue infrastructure
- No backend offline sync
- No offline-first architecture
- Limited PWA features

### 5. **Live Chat** (50% Complete)
- Chat endpoints exist
- WebSocket infrastructure present
- **Missing**: Real-time conversation state management
- **Missing**: Multi-turn dialogue handling
- **Missing**: Context preservation across sessions

### 6. **Custom Voices** (Configuration Only)
- ElevenLabs voice ID configured
- No voice customization UI
- No voice training capability
- Single voice option

## 🔍 Code Reality Check

### What the code shows:
```python
# Many methods like this exist:
async def execute_walkthrough(self, target: str):
    """Execute guided walkthrough"""
    # TODO: Implement walkthrough logic
    pass

async def run_e2e_tests(self):
    """Run E2E tests"""
    # Placeholder
    return {"status": "not_implemented"}
```

### Voice capabilities:
- Can synthesize speech from text ✅
- Can stream audio ✅
- Cannot maintain conversation context ❌
- Cannot guide users through UI ❌

### Testing capabilities:
- Has test endpoints ✅
- Has basic health checks ✅
- No integration with AUREA ❌
- No automated UI testing ❌

## 📊 Implementation Status by Feature

| Feature | Planned | Implemented | Working |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Core AUREA Engine | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Voice Synthesis | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Live Conversation | ✅ | Partial | ❌ |
| E2E Testing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Voice Walkthrough | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Machine Learning | ✅ | Minimal | ❌ |
| Offline Mode | ✅ | Partial | ❌ |
| Custom Voices | ✅ | Config Only | ❌ |
| Multi-LLM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Memory System | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🎯 What Would Be Needed

### For E2E Testing:
1. Playwright/Puppeteer integration
2. Test scenario definitions
3. AUREA test command handlers
4. Results reporting system
5. Screenshot/video capture

### For Voice Walkthrough:
1. UI element mapping system
2. Navigation state machine
3. Context-aware prompts
4. Voice command recognition
5. Step-by-step guidance logic

### For Full Machine Learning:
1. Training data collection
2. Model fine-tuning pipeline
3. Feedback loop implementation
4. Behavior prediction system
5. Continuous learning infrastructure

## 💡 Current Capability Summary

**AUREA CAN:**
- Process text/voice commands
- Synthesize voice responses
- Execute backend operations
- Store conversation memory
- Switch between AI providers

**AUREA CANNOT:**
- Conduct live E2E tests
- Guide users through voice walkthrough
- Learn from user interactions
- Work fully offline
- Maintain real-time conversation flow

## 🚨 Reality vs. Marketing

The codebase shows AUREA as a **command processor with voice output**, not a fully autonomous AI assistant. Many advanced features exist as placeholders or partial implementations.

**Estimated completion**: 60% of envisioned features

## 💬 Example Conversations

### Before (Template-based):
```
User: "What should I focus on today?"
AUREA: "Today's revenue is $5,420, up 15% from yesterday..."
```

### Now (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):
```
User: "What should I focus on today?"
AUREA: "Based on your current metrics, I recommend focusing on three key areas today:

1. **Follow up on the Johnson project** - It's been 3 days since the estimate, and this $12,000 job would significantly boost this month's revenue.

2. **Review crew schedules** - You have 8 active projects but some overlap in Thursday's schedule that needs resolution.

3. **Material orders** - With 4 projects starting next week, placing orders today ensures no delays.

Your revenue is trending 15% above last month, so maintaining project momentum is crucial. Would you like me to draft the follow-up email for Johnson?"
```

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy v3.1.144 on Render**
   - Docker image already pushed
   - Contains all natural language features

2. **Test Natural Language**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://brainops-backend-prod.onrender.com/api/v1/aurea-natural/command \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "command": "Explain my business performance this week",
       "session_id": "test_session"
     }'
   ```

3. **Access Enhanced Web Interface**
